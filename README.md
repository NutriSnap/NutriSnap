# ü•ï NutriSnap

NutriSnap is a mobile application that allows users to take a picture of their food and receive nutritional information about the food. The application uses a machine learning model to identify the food in the picture and other relevant information to determine nutritional information and classify the meal according to NOVA classification guidelines. The application also allows users to save their food and view their food history.
